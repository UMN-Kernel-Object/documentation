Students
--------
**Nathan Anye**

I am a student at UMN, interested in machine learning: mainly computer vision
and natural language processing. My Linux journey started with Linux Mint
20.04. My favorite programming language is Python. I am a fellow Hawaiian pizza enjoyer.

**Jake Freeland**

Computer Science Major at UMN with interest in operating systems and low-level
machine architecture. I started my Linux journey with Linux Mint Qiana in 2014.
I am a FreeBSD user and contributor, my favorite programming language is C, and
I happen to be a Hawaiian pizza fan.


**Evan Voogd**
Computer Science Major at UMN with interest in operating systems. I started my
Linux journey with Ubuntu running in WSL back in the summer before my freshman
year. I use Vim and am neutral on the issue of pineapple pizza.

**Khan Winter**

I was a beekeeper for 3 years! In that time I wound up with 0 jars of honey, 1 happy bear,
and too many bee stings to count.

**Shaun Loo**
I'm a junior CS major here at UMN. I am also the sysadmin for ACM UMN, and a
DJ for Radio K. My Linux journey started with some version of Ubuntu (14.04?).
My favouite cartoon is Gravity Falls.

**Alec Lorimer**

I am a graduate student that came back to school after working as a firmware
engineer for two years after undergrad. I have interests in distributed
computing, high preformance computing, and operating systems. My favorite
programming languages bounce between C/C++ and Python depending on how
lazy I am feeling.

**Cas Hermann**
Computer Science major with an interest in embedded systems and data communications.

**Brendan Gee**

A computer science major who doesn't have a lot of experience with Linux but is excited to learn more. My favorite type of music is EDM. Check out Porter Robinson.

**Minrui Tian**

I am a junior majored in Computer Science. I am interested in operating systems, distributed systems and cloud computing.
I was exposed to Linux kernel when I taught myself a MIT operating system course 6.828, which has labs to develop a Unix xv6 operating system on Linux Ubuntu.
I am currently working on a project from a distribued system course -- MIT 6.824 using Go. My favorite languages are C/C++ and Go.

**Noah Hendrickson**
A junior in computer science interested in Graphics, Machine Learning,
and the intersection of the two, as well as dabbling a bit in Operating systems
and distributed computing...maybe. My favorite programming
language bounces between C, C++, and Rust. (and Javascript but shhh I didn't admit that)
I also really like kiwis :)

**Kirsten Ericson**
Currently a junior in the Computer Science program. Interested in lots of
 different topics, but am most interested in front end development. I am excited
 to be interning with Target this summer for software development, and a fun
 fact about me is I will always be the pink-est person in the room.


**Joel Kuehne**

I am currently a freshman pursuing Computer Engineering. My Linux journey started when I
repurposed my old laptop into a minecraft server running Ubuntu server. C++ all the way.
Delicious juicy pineapple does belong on pizza.


**Angie Chen**

Computer science major, [attempting an] art minor. I don't have much experience with Linux.
I am fond of birds.

Advisors

**Alex Elder**

**Chris Kauffman**

**Jack Kolb**

I mainly teach undergraduate CS courses on architecture and operating systems.
My Linux journey started with Ubuntu 8.04. My favorite programming language
keyword is `with`, from Python, and my favorite type of pizza is the
ever-controversial Hawaiian.
