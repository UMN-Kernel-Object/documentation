\begin{frame}{Project Subgroup}
	\pause
	\begin{block}{Goal}
		This subgroup's goal is to make a meaningful and useful patchset for the kernel, and get it accepted upstream after passing appropriate review.

		\vspace{1em}

		A secondary goal is to let members newer to kernel programming see how more experienced members solve different problems in the kernel, and to encourage dialogue between these groups.
	\end{block}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This kind of thing is how we get unbanned from the kernel!
		\item It'll also hopefully turn into an academic publication, which is nice to have on a resume
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Organization}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> Mostly online, through Discord and GitHub
			\begin{itemize}
				\item ``Real'' kernel work doesn't use GitHub, but this will make it much easier for people to dip their toes in
			\end{itemize}
		\item<2-> Three main prongs
			\begin{itemize}
				\item<2-> Development work on the project -- hopefully most people in the subgroup make some change at some point, even if it's ``just'' working on docs, comments, or tests
				\item<3-> Development streams with Q\&A -- a core group of 2-5 volunteers that commit to doing 2-3 hours of dev work every 2 weeks, streaming it on Discord, and answering questions from people who join the call (e.g. ``why are you using \texttt{GFP\_KERNEL\_ACCOUNT} here, what does that flag mean?'')
				\item<4-> Code review with the whole group -- this might be every other or every third meeting in the spring?
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Project Idea -- Problem}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``LL/SC dirops'' (I'm open to a better name...)
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{example}
		\begin{semiverbatim}
			\input{before.c}
		\end{semiverbatim}
	\end{example}

	\begin{itemize}
		\pause
		\item This code has a security bug!
		      \pause
		\item What if an attacker replaces \texttt{path} with a hard-link to \texttt{/bin} between \texttt{stat} and \texttt{chown}?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Project Idea -- Solution}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A solution I thought of:
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Have a version of \texttt{stat} that sets a flag on the file (the dirent)
			      \item Any modification of the file clears the flag, no matter who does it
			      \item Have a version of \texttt{chown} that only works if the flag is set -- otherwise, it returns an error
			            \begin{itemize}
				            \item As with all modifications, this version of \texttt{chown} clears the flag when it modifies the file
			            \end{itemize}
		      \end{itemize}
		\item The project is to implement this in the kernel -- also other syscalls than \texttt{chown} (e.g. \texttt{unlink}, \texttt{chmod})
		\item Initial version hopefully takes a couple weeks of dev streams, then we get to benchmarking, optimization, code review, ...
	\end{itemize}
