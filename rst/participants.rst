Students
--------
**Nathan Anye**

I am a student at UMN, interested in machine learning: mainly computer vision
and natural language processing. My Linux journey started with Linux Mint
20.04. My favorite programming language is Python. I am a fellow Hawaiian pizza enjoyer.

**Jake Freeland**

Computer Science Major at UMN with interest in operating systems and low-level
machine architecture. I started my Linux journey with Linux Mint Qiana in 2014.
I am a FreeBSD user and contributor, my favorite programming language is C, and
I happen to be a Hawaiian pizza fan.


**Evan Voogd**
Computer Science Major at UMN with interest in operating systems. I started my
Linux journey with Ubuntu running in WSL back in the summer before my freshman
year. I use Vim and am neutral on the issue of pineapple pizza.

**Khan Winter**

I was a beekeeper for 3 years! In that time I wound up with 0 jars of honey, 1 happy bear,
and too many bee stings to count.

**Shaun Loo**

I'm a junior CS major here at UMN. I am also the sysadmin for ACM UMN, and a
DJ for Radio K. My Linux journey started with some version of Ubuntu (14.04?).
My favouite cartoon is Gravity Falls.

**Alec Lorimer**

I am a graduate student that came back to school after working as a firmware
engineer for two years after undergrad. I have interests in distributed
computing, high preformance computing, and operating systems. My favorite
programming languages bounce between C/C++ and Python depending on how
lazy I am feeling.

**Cas Hermann**
Computer Science major with an interest in embedded systems and data communications.

**Brendan Gee**

A computer science major who doesn't have a lot of experience with Linux but is excited to learn more. My favorite type of music is EDM. Check out Porter Robinson.

**Minrui Tian**

I am a junior majored in Computer Science. I am interested in operating systems, distributed systems and cloud computing.
I was exposed to Linux kernel when I taught myself a MIT operating system course 6.828, which has labs to develop a Unix xv6 operating system on Linux Ubuntu.
I am currently working on a project from a distribued system course -- MIT 6.824 using Go. My favorite languages are C/C++ and Go.

**Noah Hendrickson**
A junior in computer science interested in Graphics, Machine Learning,
and the intersection of the two, as well as dabbling a bit in Operating systems
and distributed computing...maybe. My favorite programming
language bounces between C, C++, and Rust. (and Javascript but shhh I didn't admit that)
I also really like kiwis :)

**Kirsten Ericson**
Currently a junior in the Computer Science program. Interested in lots of
 different topics, but am most interested in front end development. I am excited
 to be interning with Target this summer for software development, and a fun
 fact about me is I will always be the pink-est person in the room.


**Joel Kuehne**

I am currently a freshman pursuing Computer Engineering. My Linux journey started when I
repurposed my old laptop into a minecraft server running Ubuntu server. C++ all the way.
Delicious juicy pineapple does belong on pizza.


**Angie Chen**

Computer science major, [attempting an] art minor. I don't have much experience with Linux.
I am fond of birds.

**William Lin**

Hello, I am a sophomore currently majoring in Computer Science.
I am interesting in a wide range of things in CS, but am not sure what to settle in.
I haven't worked with the Linux kernel before but I have messed with a few linux distros, mainly Arch and Ubuntu.
I don't really have favorite language, but I usually prototype in Python and look to finalize projects with Java.

**Jada Lilleboe**
Computer science major interested in learning more about the Linux kernel! My favorite
programming languages are OCaml and Python.

**[Hanan Abdirahman]**
I am Computer Science major. I love movies and tv shows.


**Margaret Degen**
I am junior majoring in Computer Science.My favorite languages are Python,C++, and Javascript.

**Sam Highbargin**
I am a first year Master's student. My primary field of research is the various species of wildcats
and the cuteness of their kittens. I've been a TA for almost three years now, so if you've had a
class with a bunch of cat pictures on the lab slides, it was probably me. My favorite language is C.
